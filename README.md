# FirstRPG

## Overview

First Role-Playing Game created only using OpenGL, coded from scratch. All artworks used are created by me. The setting was inspired by the first chapter in [The Last Wish: Introducing the Witcher](https://www.amazon.com/Last-Wish-Introducing-Witcher/dp/0316029181) written by Andrzej Sapkowski. Depending on the actions players take during the quest, the outcome is different.

## Gameplay Instructions

* Press W,A,S,D to control the character to move up, left, down, right.
* Press shift to toggle sprint.
* Press J to attack.
* Press spacebar to skip dialogues.
* When prompted with a response, if you wish to accept, press Y.
To interact with the NPCs, simply walk up to them.

## Notes
